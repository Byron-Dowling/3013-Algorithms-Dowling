## Program 2 - P02 - Processing in Linear Time
### Byron Dowling
### Description:

This project is about loading a singly linked list with dictionary words, then timing how it takes to look them up. We are doing this with the knowledge that this is slow, and we plan on applying our "lookup" code to other backend data structures with better performance. So, keep this in mind when designing your program.

### Instructions

- The program can be run from your machine's console or from this replit project: https://repl.it/@ByronDowling/Getching#main.cpp
- The program expects an input text file of dictionary words which is provided in this repo
- Once the program launches and the linked list is loaded, the user simply types on the keyboard to start searching for word matches
- The getching portion of the program will capture the user input despite not displaying within the terminal
- If you mistype a letter, simply hit the backspace and the terminal will recognize and revert back to the previous iteration
- Hit Shift - Z to terminate the program.
